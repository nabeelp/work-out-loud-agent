# WOLA Implementation Plan

This implementation plan provides a step-by-step checklist for developing the WOLA solution, based on the product requirements and solution architecture. The plan is structured to enable an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) as early as possible, with each stage being demonstrable.

---

## 1. Project Setup & Foundations
- [ ] Initialize repository structure and version control
- [ ] Set up Azure subscription and resource group
- [ ] Provision Azure Cosmos DB (or emulator for local dev)
- [ ] Set up Azure Entra ID (Azure AD) app registrations for SSO (Teams bot & web app)
- [ ] Configure Microsoft Graph API permissions (least privilege)
- [ ] Set up Azure Container Apps environment for web/API and background jobs
- [ ] Set up Azure Bot Service for Teams bot
- [ ] Establish CI/CD pipeline for build and deployment

---

## 2. Core MVP: Daily Summary Generation & Delivery
- [ ] Implement user authentication (SSO) for web app and Teams bot
- [ ] Implement user onboarding flow (Teams bot and web app)
- [ ] Implement background job to fetch sent emails, calendar events, and Teams messages via Microsoft Graph API
- [ ] Implement logic to group activities by customer (email domain/calendar invite)
- [ ] Implement leave/no-activity day detection
- [ ] Generate Markdown summary for each day, grouped by customer and "Internal"
- [ ] Store daily summaries in Cosmos DB
- [ ] Implement email delivery of daily summary to user
- [ ] Implement email prompt if no activity is detected

---

## 3. MVP Dashboard
- [ ] Implement simple web dashboard for user to view daily summaries
- [ ] Implement API endpoints for summary retrieval
- [ ] Implement manual correction/override of customer assignments via dashboard

---

## 4. Teams Bot Enhancements
- [ ] Enable Teams bot to trigger onboarding and authentication
- [ ] (Optional) Enable Teams bot to display summary on request

---

## 5. Operational & Non-Functional Tasks
- [ ] Implement error handling and retry logic for background jobs
- [ ] Apply Azure security best practices to all resources
- [ ] Document deployment and local development setup
- [ ] Review and refine retention policy for summaries

---

## 6. Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)
- [ ] Expand dashboard features (search, filtering, etc.)
- [ ] Add support for additional notification channels (e.g., Teams messages)
- [ ] Add analytics or reporting features
- [ ] Support for additional data sources or integrations (if required)

---

This checklist should be updated as tasks are completed and as requirements evolve during development.
